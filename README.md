As much as I love nightTab, I had a few problems with it:

1. It doesn't sync across devices
2. It's kind of slow and bloated. It becomes very tedious to add / edit many bookmarks at once. I do this every now and then when changing domain names on my home server.
3. The configuration file is huge. It's too big / complex to modify with a script, and too big to back up to something like GitHub, where I like to keep the rest of my dotfiles.

So I created helios to address these problems. It sacrifices customization for simplicity. It's fast, the data file is very small, and it's hosted, so there's no worrying about synchronization.
